# MCC School Website
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/TfldF-r53FY
#### Description:
I was thinking of a project that could possibly benefit my school.
Then I thought of a website for them and though it'd be a great idea to do so.
I first started with a draft on a paper, imagined how my website should look like.
The final version vs what I had on my mind is a little bit similar, the only thing that was changed was the structures of my website.
The journey of me making this website can be described in three sentences
1. It was confusing as sometimes it doesn't let me do what I want
2. It was rewarding when I finally understood how to do what I want
3. Lastly, it's a cycle of between the two feelings lol,
Overall, I enjoyed the course

Then the organization of files comes from, all images in the images folder. Then the bootstrapp assets in assets.
And then all html files are in the parent directory. I decided to use index.html as a filename for my homepage as I'll publish these in github pages soon.
So inside of my index.html are the homepage details where in you can see the courses, the photos of the school and then the mission, vision and values.
Basically, index.html connects every webpages together.
The sob is for School of Business
Everything in School of business such as it's majors
And then some photos of it as well

The soe is for School of Education
Same thing in here, majors and then some photos

The sot is for School of Technology
The same thing as the two above
Majors and photos were included here

The contact_us.html shows
- the email and facebook page for the school
- the map directions to the physical address of it.


The about.html is just a short description on the school itself.

So this design in mind, I did it this way because MCC itself is color green
Then I made the header green but the contrast between the default green and the black text was so bad
The solution I came up with was decreasing the contrast of the header.
Worked pretty well for my eyes at least

Now, let's go to the photos that I chose. These are all photos downloaded in the school's facebook page.
I purposefully choose the photos which are low in light because the text that's displayed on each photos is white. So the contrast is good right from the start

I had some problems encountered when bootstrap wasn't performing a slideshow in the photos, it was puzzling as I have no idea how to fixed it. I scrutinize every line of code in my index.html seeing if there is something that I missed or just needs to be re-adjusted. I spent an hour doing that and the mistake that I did was I forgot to put the assets folder. Oh my god, but thank god finally it worked.

The vision, mission and core values, I decided to add that as the school right from our start of enrollment only focused on teaching us into that. So it might definetly have some importance of it that they shoved it up on our face for the first week in school. That's why I decided to add that in the website and specifically made it in the front page because of its high importance.

Originally, the news was supposed to be a recent posts of our facebook page, however my research told me that I can't possibly embed latest posts, I must embed manually for each posts in our facebook page which isn't what I want. So I just dropped that feature, linked the facebook page only and then feature done.

Now, the photos, gallery, I decided to just linked it to our facebook photos page because it would be much more updated and also would take up less space, load quickly as hundreds of photos aren't  stuffed in the folder itself. It would've been nice but we live in a poor internet speed country so the speed of loading times is really important


Also, I decided to use bootstrap as it saves my time and also at the same time it's a mobile-friendly web design approach by default as I also want the mobile users to be able to see and use it in their mobile devices.

But yeah, that's it, I enjoyed my time here in CS50.
